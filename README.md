  <p><strong>Altair itself is ad-free, but it happens that providers insert their own ads. For the best experience, I recommend using <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Altair is the brightest star in the constellation of Aquila and the twelfth-brightest star in the night sky. It has the Bayer designation Alpha Aquilae, which is Latinised from α Aquilae and abbreviated Alpha Aql or α Aql. (Via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair">Wikipedia</a>)</strong></p>
